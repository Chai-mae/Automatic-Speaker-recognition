# Automatic-Speaker-recognition
## Introduction :
Automatic speaker recognition is a part of speech analysis, it is the set of techniques and algorithms allowing the automatic identification and authentication of individuals based on their unique speech characteristics, such as their patterns voices, their speech patterns and other acoustic characteristics. There are two types of recognition:

• Text-dependent recognition in this case the algorithm is trained by pre-established sentences and said by all the speakers to be recognized
• Recognition independent of the text in this case there is no training following one or more specific sentences
The majority of the solutions developed for speaker recognition aim either to identify the speaker, i.e. to recognize the person who spoke among a group of speakers, or else verification or authentication which consists of checking with a minimal level of doubt that a person is the one who recorded their voice during verification.
